# Frogger Project - Programming Language Course

## Description

This project is developed as part of the Programming Language course in the second year of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. It is an implementation of the Frogger game, where the goal is to guide a frog across a dangerous environment to reach one of the three lily pads within a limited time.

## Game Rules

The player controls a frog that must be moved to one of the three lily pads at the top of the screen.

- The player has 3 lives.

- Obstacles (cars, logs, etc.) can slow down or kill the frog.

- If the frog is hit by an obstacle, it loses a life and restarts from the starting point.

- If the time runs out before reaching a lily pad, a life is lost.

- Once all three lily pads are occupied, the player wins the game.

## Technologies Used

- Language: C++

- Libraries: FLTK


## Run the game:

With a Makefile
